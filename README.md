# Exercise Sessions in Foundations of Number Theory
##### Tuesdays 8-10 (Room 0.008), winter term 2023/2024, Uni Bonn

## Anouncements
Exercise sessions start at 8:30!


## Solutions to the exercise sheets
Warning: These are my preperations for the exercise sessions. There might be errors, some solutions might even be completely wrong. If you think you found an error or have questions regarding these solutions, feel free to write me :)

* [Sheet 1](Sheet01/Sheet01.pdf) (mostly) results on algebraic integers.
* [Sheet 2](Sheet02/Sheet02.pdf) Computations with norm and trace, a integral extension of the integers with infinitely many units, all finite free modules over integral domains are submodules of a free module.
* [Sheet 3](Sheet03/Sheet03.pdf) More units of rings of integers, quadratic extensions, cubic extensions, quadratic extensions of quadratic extensions (and fun facts about the flag of Nepal!).

* [Sheet 4](Sheet04/Sheet04.pdf) Discriminants of quadratic number fields, further calculations with special cubic number fields, first facts about Dedekind domains.
